**Company Name:** Lootah Biofuels  

**About Lootah Biofuels:**  
Lootah Biofuels was founded in 2010 in Dubai to address the growing demand for alternative fuels in the region. In alignment with the UAE’s vision for sustainable development, Lootah Biofuels aims to introduce and innovate sustainable solutions for the long-term energy requirements. By rapidly increasing production capacity, strengthening distribution channels, and redefining biodiesel quality, Lootah Biofuels continues to expand the reach of sustainable and environmentally friendly biofuels.  

**Our Mission:**  
Our mission is to deliver economic, operational, and environmental benefits for long-term customer satisfaction and sustainable growth.  

**Our Aim:**  
We aim to research, develop, and produce sustainable biofuels—clean, reliable alternatives to fossil fuels for transport that deliver real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and help improve energy security.  

**Our Founder:**  
The CEO of Lootah Biofuels is Yousif Bin Saeed Al Lootah. A young and enthusiastic leader, Mr. Yousif Lootah oversees the daily operations of Lootah Biofuels in the UAE and globally, as well as the company’s strategic direction, growth, and expansion. With a vision for innovating sustainable solutions for long-term energy needs, Mr. Yousif Lootah launched Lootah Biofuels.  

Prior to founding Lootah Biofuels, Mr. Yousif was actively involved in sustainability initiatives such as the Green Car Program, which has significantly progressed since its inception. The initiative started with converting part of the company fleet to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and expanded to include hybrid, electric, biodiesel, and solar vehicles.

Mr. Yousif Lootah aims for 70% of transportation in the GCC market to come from renewable and sustainable sources by 2025. He envisions the UAE becoming the first nation in the region to mandate biofuel blends at all public stations. Many of the company’s ecological initiatives were his brainchild. Following the success of biofuel creation from waste management, Mr. Lootah recently signed agreements with educational institutions to raise awareness and provide training to the region’s youth, encouraging impactful sustainable practices.

**UCO Division:**  
**Used Cooking Oil (UCO):**  
Lootah Biofuels has successfully developed a practical and viable solution to produce biofuel from Used Cooking Oil (UCO), resulting in a less expensive, renewable, and clean fuel. We are one of the largest UCO collectors authorized by Dubai Municipality and the only one with our own fuel outlets across Dubai.  

Key Highlights:  
- We provide financial incentives to UCO providers.  
- Our main UCO sources include restaurants, bakeries, and food chains.  
- By efficiently converting UCO waste into biofuel, we support the Municipality in preventing environmental hazards such as sewage problems.  
- As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility, we prevent UCO from re-entering the food chain by converting it into fuel.  
- UCO has the highest carbon-saving ratio among all available biodiesel feedstocks.

   Lootah Biofuels also produces glycerine, a by-product of the biodiesel production process. Glycerine is a versatile product used in various industries, including:

   - Acts as a lubricant to reduce carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.  
   - Is derived from converting used cooking oil to Biodiesel (B100) and blending it with high-quality ultra-low-sulfur petro-diesel in a 5:95 ratio.
